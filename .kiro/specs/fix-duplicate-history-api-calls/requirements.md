# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The application currently makes duplicate calls to the `/api/tasks/history` endpoint when the page refreshes. This creates unnecessary server load and potential performance issues. The goal is to optimize the API calls to ensure only one history request is made per page load.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to load efficiently without making redundant API calls, so that the page loads faster and server resources are used optimally.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the page is refreshed THEN the system SHALL make only one call to `/api/tasks/history`
2. WHEN the useAsyncTasks hook is initialized THEN the system SHALL prevent duplicate history loading calls
3. WHEN multiple components use the same hook THEN the system SHALL ensure history is loaded only once per session

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to identify the root cause of duplicate API calls, so that I can implement a proper fix that prevents future occurrences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing the code THEN the system SHALL identify all locations where history API calls are made
2. WHEN examining the useAsyncTasks hook THEN the system SHALL identify dependency issues causing re-execution
3. WHEN reviewing the loadHistoryTasks function THEN the system SHALL ensure proper memoization and dependency management

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to reduce unnecessary server load, so that the application performs better and costs are optimized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the fix is implemented THEN the system SHALL reduce history API calls by 50%
2. WHEN monitoring network requests THEN the system SHALL show only one history call per page load
3. WHEN testing the application THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing functionality while reducing API calls
